* Data extraction and processing  

    + Worked with monitoring and evaluation officers in Africa to develop mySQL script identify key               variables to extract  
    + Extracted longitudinal data for ~25000 subjects from 7 clinics in Sub-Saharan Africa in the time            period 2013-2018 o Cleaned, processed, run quality checks and check completeness of data    
* Statistical Analysis  

    + Consulted subject matter experts to identify a priori list of variables that are hypothesized to be         related to unfavorable TB outcomes  
    + Developed regularized regression models (multiple models categorizing subjects according to ARV use)        to identify risk factors associated with unfavorable TB outcomes  
    + Developed a Bayesian mixed effect model to find associations between ART use and TB incidence.  
    + Presented findings of the project in the network wide meeting held in Johannesburg, South Africa            (November-2018) â€“ manuscript in preparation    

*Studying underlying epigenetic mechanism of TB infection*  

* Processed methylation data from EPIC arrays consisting of ~850,000 individual probes using the minfi        package from Bioconductor  
* Ingenuity Pathway analysis to identify an epigenetic signature associated with TB infection in HIV          positive children  
* Analyze flow cytometry data to understand mechanistic interactions  
* Produce exploratory data analysis reports    

*Managing Clinical Research Database*  

* Automated a pipeline in Python for merging of datasets from clinical research forms(CRFs) entered in        eSwatini  
* Run quality checks monthly on data extracted from the database  
* Worked with database management team to remove redundancies across datasets reducing the size and number    of variables to be extracted

*Statistical Analysis*  

* Assist scientists and postdocs with statistical analysis of proteomic and genomic data
* Apply statistical methods such as hierarchical clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) and regression on multivariate data to identify features (genes/proteins) associated with a particular phenotype o Prepare publication quality figures and tables for manuscripts
