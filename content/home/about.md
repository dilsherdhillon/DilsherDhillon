### Biography

I work as a Statistician with Baylor College of Medicine. I work mostly with electronic medical record data collected in clinics across sub-saharan Africa and helping clinicians answer specific questions from these large longitudinal datasets. I also work with researchers in Baylor to help them get better insights into their experimental lab data.   

Prior to being a statistician, I worked for on early detection of cancer using proteomic assays helping develop sensitive blood-based diagnostic tools to detect cancer.
