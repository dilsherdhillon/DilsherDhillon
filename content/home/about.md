### Biography

I work as a statistician with Baylor College of Medicine. I work mostly with electronic medical record data collected in clinics across sub-saharan Africa and helping clinicians answer specific questions from these large longitudinal datasets. I also work with researchers in Baylor to help them get better insights into their experimental lab data.   

Prior to being a full-time statistician, I worked on analyzing mass spectrometry data and developing sensitive blood-based diagnostics assays for early detection of cancer including  [lung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30003238) and [pancreatic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28376157).
