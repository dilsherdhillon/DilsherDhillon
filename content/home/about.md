### Work    
I work as a statistical consultant in the data science centre of excellence at Shell, Houston TX. Within the data science COE I'm part of a statistical consulting team that provides statistical support to researchers and engineers , mostly in the fuels and lubricants business of Shell. This includes planning and design of experiments, data management, statistical analysis and writing statistical reports for marketing claims.    

In addition, I work with the machine learning team to support the statistical and data science needs of west Texas permian basin on-shore drilling operations.   

### Skills   
Tools and algorithms that I am most familiar with and frequently use include ANOVAs, regularized regression models, generalized additive models(GAMs), multilevel models , auto-regressive time series models,  boosting tree models, bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs).   I primarily use and prefer R and Stan for most of my work, with some python by virtue of working with a machine learning team that uses it.   

I'm an advocate for reproducible research and generate all statistical analyis reports in Rmarkdown and for projects requring statistical analysis review, I encourage the use of docker containers to ensure reproducibility.  

Outside of work my time is spent between reading books and case studies on bayesian modeling, crossfit and frequenting a local brewery in town.   

Prior to being a statistician, I worked as a bench scientist developing sensitive blood-based diagnostics assays for early detection of cancer including  [lung](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30003238) and [pancreatic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28376157) at MD Anderson Cancer Center.
